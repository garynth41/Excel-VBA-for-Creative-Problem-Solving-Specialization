# Excel/VBA for Creative Problem Solving, Part 1

"Excel/VBA for Creative Problem Solving, Part 1" is aimed at learners who are seeking to augment, expand, optimize, and increase the efficiency of their Excel spreadsheet skills by tapping into the powerful programming, automation, and customization capabilities available with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).  

This course is the first part of a three-part series and Specialization that focuses on the application of computing techniques in Excel/VBA to solve problems.  In this course (Part 1), you will: 1) create macros to automate procedures in Excel; 2) define your own user-defined functions; 3) create basic subroutines to interface with the user; 4) learn the basic programming structures in VBA; and 5) automate Excel’s Goal Seek and Solver tExcel & VBA for Creative Problem Solving, Part 1ools and use numerical techniques to create “live solutions” to solve targeting and optimization problems.

New to computer programming?  The extremely intuitive and visual nature of VBA lends itself nicely to teaching and learning - what a fun way to learn to code!  No prior knowledge in programming nor advanced math skills are necessary yet seasoned programmers will pick up new and creative spreadsheet problem solving strategies.

After you have learned the basics of VBA, each module will introduce foundational and broad problems inspired by situations that you might encounter in the real world.  To pass each module, you'll need to pass a mastery quiz and complete a problem solving assignment.  This course is unique in that the weekly assignments are completed in-application (i.e., on your own computer in Excel), providing you with valuable hands-on training.
