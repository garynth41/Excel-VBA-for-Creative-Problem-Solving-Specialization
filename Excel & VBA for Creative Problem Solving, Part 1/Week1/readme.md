# Macro recording, VBA procedures, and debugging

# Charlie Nuttelman
Week 1 will introduce you to visual basic for applications (VBA) and teach you the foundational tools required to create basic procedures in VBA. You'll learn about different data types and the scope of variables, how to troubleshoot your code when it's not working, and how to record basic macros using both absolute and relative referencing modes.


# Learning Objectives
* Record a macro while applying both relative and absolute referencing.
* Create simple VBA subroutines that interface with the user.
* Describe the difference between subroutines and functions.
* Declare variables of varying data type and scope.
* Troubleshoot your code using debugging techniques.
